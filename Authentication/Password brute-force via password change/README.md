This test is done using only 100 passwods. What about 10K passwords?

You can see the comparison I made with these numbers when solving the [Lab: Username enumeration via different responses](https://github.com/elqal3awii/WebSecurity-Academy-with-Rust/tree/main/Authentication/Username%20enumeration%20via%20different%20responses) to see the big difference in speed between Rust and Python and also between single-threaded and multi-threaded approaches in Rust.
