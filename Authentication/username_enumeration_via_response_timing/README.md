# Hack Steps
1. Obtain a valid username via response timing
2. Brute force password of that valid username

# Run Script
1. change the URL of the lab
2. change the PATH for your usernames list
3. change the PATH for you passwords list
4. Start script
```
~$ python username_enumeration_via_response_timing.py
```

# Expected Output
```
[#] Enumerate usernames..
