# Hack Steps
1. Obtain a valid username via subtly different error messages
2. Brute force password of that valid username

# Run Script
1. change the URL of the lab
2. change the PATH for your usernames list
3. change the PATH for you passwords list
4. Start script
```
~$ python username_enumeration_via_different_resposnes.py
```
# Expected Output
```
