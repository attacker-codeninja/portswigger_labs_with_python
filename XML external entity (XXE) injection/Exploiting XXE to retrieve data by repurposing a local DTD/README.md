# Hack Steps

1. Inject payload into the XML-based check stock request to retrieve the content of /etc/passwd by repurposing a local DTD
2. Extract the first line as a proof

# Run Script

1. Change the URL of the lab
2. Start script

```
~$ python exploiting_xxe_to_retrieve_data_by_repurposing_a_local_dtd.py
```

# Expected Output

```
âŸª#âŸ« Injection point: XML-based check stock request
â¦—1â¦˜ Injecting payload to retrieve the content of /etc/passwd by repurposing a local DTD.. OK
â¦—2â¦˜ Extracting the first line as a proof.. OK => root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
ðŸ—¹ The lab should be marked now as solved
```
