2. Inject payload into the XML-based check stock request to retrieve the content of /etc/passwd via error message
3. Extract the first line as a proof

# Run Script

1. Change the URL of the lab
2. Change the URL of the exploit server
3. Start script

```
~$ python exploiting_blind_xxe_to_retrieve_data_via_error_messages.py
```
