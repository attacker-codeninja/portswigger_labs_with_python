## Hack Steps

1. Store the malicious DTD file in your exploit server
2. Inject payload into the check stock request to retrieve the content of /etc/passwd via error message
3. Extract the first line as a proof


## Run Script

1. Change the URL of the lab
2. Change the URL of the exploit server
3. Start script

```
~$ python main.py
```

## Expected Output

```
â¦—#â¦˜ Injection point: Check stock request
â¦—1â¦˜ Storing the malicious DTD file on your exploit server.. OK
â¦—2â¦˜ Injecting payload to retrieve the content of /etc/passwd via error message.. OK
â¦—3â¦˜ Extracting the first line as a proof.. OK => root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
ðŸ—¹ The lab should be marked now as solved
```
