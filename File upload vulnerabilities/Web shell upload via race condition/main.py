# Lab: Web shell upload via race condition
#
# Hack Steps: 
#      1. Fetch login page
#      2. Extract the csrf token and session cookie
#      3. Login as wiener
#      4. Extract the new csrf token from wiener profile
#      5. Upload the the shell file via race condition
#      6. Try to fetch the shell file concurrently from a different thread
#      7. Submit the solution
