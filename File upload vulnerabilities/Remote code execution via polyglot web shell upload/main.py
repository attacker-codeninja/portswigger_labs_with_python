# Lab: Remote code execution via polyglot web shell upload
#
# Hack Steps: 
#      1. Fetch login page
#      2. Extract the csrf token and session cookie
#      3. Login as wiener
#      4. Extract the new csrf token from wiener profile
#      5. Embed the payload in the image using exiftool
#      6. Change the extension of the image to .php
#      7. Read the image with embedded payload
#      8. Upload the image with the embedded payload
#      9. Fetch the uploaded image with the embedded payload to read the secret
#      10. Submit the solution
