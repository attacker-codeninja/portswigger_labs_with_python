#        3. Login as wiener
#        4. Fetch wiener profile
#        5. Embed the payload in the image using exiftool
#        6. Change the extension of the image to .php
#        7. Read the image with embedded payload
#        8. Upload the image with the embedded payload
#        9. Fetch the uploaded image with the embedded payload to read the secret
#        10. Submit the solution
