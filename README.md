# Clearance of Responsibility
This repository is for educational purposes only, and I am not responsible for using any of the techniques described here for illegal usage.


# Burp Suite for Labs
You can, of course, solve the labs using Burp Suite, but this repository is for those who want to take their scripting skills up to a higher level.

**NOTE:** This repository assumes that you already know how to solve the labs and want to solve them using scripts, rather than relying on Burp Suite, in order to practice writing robust scripts.
You will not find a detailed description of how the lab should be solved; instead, you will find a detailed description of how the scripts were written.


# Python for Penetration Testing
Python is very easy to learn and you can write a script in a few minutes capable of doing interesting things.

When you are a penetration tester, what you care about is speed and efficiency not the ease in writing scripts, In terms of speed, Python doesn't play well.

If you don't care about speed and you want to write a script as fast as possible then this repository may help you.

# Python Alternatives
If you are a penetration tester and are looking for more robust and faster scripts in terms of runtime, I recommend checking out the [PortSwigger Labs with Rust](https://github.com/elqalawii/portswigger_labs_with_rust) repository in which I have solved the same labs using Rust in both single-threaded and multi-threaded programming approaches.
