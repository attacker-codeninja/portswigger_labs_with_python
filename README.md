# Using Burp Suite for Labs

You can, of course, solve the labs using Burp Suite, but this repository is for those who want to take their scripting skills up to a higher level.

This repository assumes that you already know how to solve the labs and want to solve them using scripts in order to practice writing robust ones.
You may not find a detailed description of how the labs should be solved but you will find a detailed description of how the scripts were written.

# Python for Penetration Testing üë®üèª‚Äçüíª

Python is very easy to learn and you can write a script in a few minutes capable of doing interesting things.

As a penetration tester, you care about how fast you can write a script, and sometimes what matters to you is speed and efficiency rather than ease of writing scripts. If you want to write a script as quickly as possible, then Python will be your best friend. However, if you are looking for efficiency and robustness in your script, there are better options available than Python.

If you don't prioritize runtime speed and aim to write a script as quickly as possible, then this repository may assist you.

# Error Handling

Since this repository is intended for educational purposes and not for production, I have omitted some error handling, which I believe will not significantly impact your testing of the script. This decision represents a trade-off between addressing every possible scenario and prioritizing simplicity.

# Python Alternatives

If you are a penetration tester and are looking for more robust and faster scripts in terms of runtime, I recommend checking out the [WebSecurity Academy with Rust](https://github.com/elqal3awii/WebSecurity-Academy-with-Rust) repository in which I have solved the same labs using **Rust** in both single-threaded and multi-threaded programming approaches.
