# Burp Suite for Labs

You can, of course, solve the labs using Burp Suite, but this repository is for those who want to take their scripting skills up to a higher level.

**NOTE:** This repository assumes that you already know how to solve the labs and want to solve them using scripts, rather than relying on Burp Suite, in order to practice writing robust scripts.
You will not find a detailed description of how the lab should be solved; instead, you will find a detailed description of how the scripts were written.

# Python for Penetration Testing üë®üèª‚Äçüíª

Python is very easy to learn and you can write a script in a few minutes capable of doing interesting things.

When you are a penetration tester, what you care about is speed and efficiency not the ease in writing scripts, In terms of speed, Python doesn't play well.

If you don't care about speed and you want to write a script as fast as possible then this repository may help you.

# Error Handling

Since this repository is intended for educational purposes and not for production, I have omitted some error handling, which I believe will not significantly impact your testing of the script. This decision represents a trade-off between addressing every possible scenario and prioritizing simplicity.

# Coding Styles

If you go through all the scripts, you will notice that they utilize different crates and exhibit various styles. This diversity should help you observe the different ways in which scripts can be written.

# Python Alternatives

If you are a penetration tester and are looking for more robust and faster scripts in terms of runtime, I recommend checking out the [PortSwigger Labs with Rust](https://github.com/elqalawii/portswigger_labs_with_rust) repository in which I have solved the same labs using Rust in both single-threaded and multi-threaded programming approaches.
