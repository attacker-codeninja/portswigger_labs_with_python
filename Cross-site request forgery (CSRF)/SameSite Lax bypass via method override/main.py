# Lab: SameSite Lax bypass via method override
#
# Hack Steps: 
#      1. Make the request to change the email using the GET method 
#         and include an additional URL parameter to override the method
#      2. Deliver the exploit to the victim
#      3. The victim's email will be changed after they trigger the exploit
