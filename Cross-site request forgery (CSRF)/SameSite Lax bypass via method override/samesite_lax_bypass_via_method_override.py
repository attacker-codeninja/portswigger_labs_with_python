# Lab: SameSite Lax bypass via method override
#
# Steps: 1. Make the request to change the email using the GET method and include an 
#           additional URL parameter to override the method
#        2. Deliver the exploit to the victim
#        3. The victim's email will be changed after they trigger the exploit
