# Lab: SameSite Lax bypass via cookie refresh
#
# Steps: 1. Craft an HTML form for changing the email address with a script that opens
#           a new tab to force the victim to refresh their cookie and submit the form 
#           after a few seconds to make sure that the redirection occurred
#        2. Deliver the exploit to the victim
#        3. The victim's email will be changed after they trigger the exploit
