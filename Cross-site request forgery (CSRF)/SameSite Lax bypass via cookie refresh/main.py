# Lab: SameSite Lax bypass via cookie refresh
#
# Hack Steps: 
#      1. Craft an HTML form for changing the email address with a script that opens
#         a new tab to force the victim to refresh their cookie and submit the form
#         after a few seconds to make sure that the redirection occurred
#      2. Deliver the exploit to the victim
#      3. The victim's email will be changed after they trigger the exploit
