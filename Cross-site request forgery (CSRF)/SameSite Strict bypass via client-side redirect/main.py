# Lab: SameSite Strict bypass via client-side redirect
#
# Hack Steps: 
#      1. Exploit the redirection functionality that occurs after 
#         a comment is submitted in order to redirect the victim to their profile  
#         and change their email using URL parameters
#      2. Deliver the exploit to the victim
#      3. The victim's email will be changed after they trigger the exploit
