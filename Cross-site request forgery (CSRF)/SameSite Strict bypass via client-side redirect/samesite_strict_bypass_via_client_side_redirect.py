# Lab: SameSite Strict bypass via client-side redirect
#
# Steps: 1. Exploit the redirection functionality that occurs after a comment is submitted
#           in order to redirect the victim to their profile and change their email using
#           URL parameters
#        2. Deliver the exploit to the victim
#        3. The victim's email will be changed after they trigger the exploit
