# Lab: CSRF where token validation depends on token being present
#
# Steps: 1. Craft an HTML form for changing the email address with an auto-submit 
#           script and doesn't include the csrf token in the form
#        2. Deliver the exploit to the victim
#        3. The victim's email will be changed after they trigger the exploit
