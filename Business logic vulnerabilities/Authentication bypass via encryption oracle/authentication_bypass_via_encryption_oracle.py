# Lab: Authentication bypass via encryption oracle
#
# Steps: 1. Fetch the login page
#        2. Extract the csrf token and session cookie to login
#        3. Login as wiener
#        4. Extract the stay-logged-in cookie
#        5. Fetch a post page with the stay-logged in cookie value in the notification 
#           cookie to decrypt it
#        6. Extract the decrypted value
#        7. Extract the csrf token to post a comment
#        8. Post a comment with <PADDING>administrator:<NUMBER> in the email field 
#           ( where PADDING is 9 bytes and and NUMBER is extracted from the decrypted value 
#           in the previous step )
#        9. Extract the notification cookie
#        10. Decode the notification cookie with base64
#        11. Remove the first two blocks and encode the remaining blocks
#        12. Place the last encoded value in the stay-logged-in cookie and delete carlos
