## Hack Steps

1. Fetch the login page
2. Extract the csrf token and session cookie to login
3. Login as wiener
4. Extract the stay-logged-in cookie
5. Fetch a post page with the stay-logged in cookie value in the notification cookie to decrypt it
6. Extract the decrypted value
7. Extract the csrf token to post a comment
8. Post a comment with PADDINGadministrator:NUMBERS in the email field ( where PADDING is 9 bytes and NUMBERS is extracted from the decrypted value in the previous step )
9. Extract the notification cookie
10. Decode the notification cookie with base64
11. Remove the first two blocks and encode the remaining blocks
12. Place the last encoded value in the stay-logged-in cookie and delete carlos

## Run Script
