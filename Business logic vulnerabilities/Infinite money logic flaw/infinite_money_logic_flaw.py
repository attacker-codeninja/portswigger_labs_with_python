# Steps: 1. Fetch the login page
#        2. Extract the csrf token and session cookie
#        3. Login as wiener
#        4. Fetch wiener's profile
#        5. Extract the csrf token needed for subsequent requests
#        6. Add 10 gift cards to the cart
#        7. Apply the coupon SIGNUP30
#        8. Place order
#        9. Fetch the email client
#       10. Collect the received gift card codes
#       11. Redeem the codes one by one
#       12. Repeat the stpes from 6 to 11 multiple times (42 is enough to get the 
#           price of the leather jacket)
