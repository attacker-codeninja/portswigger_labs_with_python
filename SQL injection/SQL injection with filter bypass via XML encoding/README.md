## Hack Steps

1. Inject payload into storeId XML element to retrieve administrator password using UNION-based attack
2. Extract administrator password from the response body
3. Fetch the login page
4. Extract the csrf token and session cookie
5. Login as the administrator
6. Fetch the administrator profile

## Run Script

1. Change the URL of the lab
2. Start script

```
~$ python main.py
```

## Expected Output

```
â¦—#â¦˜ Injection point: storeId
â¦—1â¦˜ Injecting payload to retrieve administrator password using UNION-based attack.. OK
â¦—2â¦˜ Extracting administrator password from the response.. OK => qfxqd57jmq5y5nbgjrfe
â¦—3â¦˜ Fetching the login page.. OK
â¦—4â¦˜ Extracting the csrf token and session cookie.. OK
â¦—5â¦˜ Logging in as administrator.. OK
â¦—6â¦˜ Fetching the administrator profile.. OK
ðŸ—¹ The lab should be marked now as solved
```

# Note

- You may need to adjust the pattern when extracting the administrator password (see the comment I left in the script)
