# Lab: SQL injection with filter bypass via XML encoding
#
# Steps: 1. Inject payload into storeId XML element to retrieve administrator password
#           using UNION-based attack
#        2. Extract administrator password from the response body
#        3. Fetch the login page
#        4. Extract the csrf token and session cookie
#        5. Login as the administrator
#        6. Fetch the administrator profile
