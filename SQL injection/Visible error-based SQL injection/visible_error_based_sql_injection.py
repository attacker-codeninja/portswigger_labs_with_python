# Lab: Visible error-based SQL injection
#
# Steps: 1. Inject payload into 'TrackingId' cookie to make the database return
#           an error containing the administrator password
#        2. Extract the administrator password
#        3. Fetch the login page
#        4. Extract csrf token and session cookie
#        5. Login as the administrator
#        6. Fetch the administrator profile
