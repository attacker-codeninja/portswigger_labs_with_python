# Lab: Blind OS command injection with output redirection
#
# Steps: 1. Fetch the feedback page
#        2. Extract csrf token and session cookie
#        3. Inject payload into the name field when submitting a feedback to
#           execute the `whoami` command and redirect the output to a text file
#           in a writable directory
#        4. Read the new created file
