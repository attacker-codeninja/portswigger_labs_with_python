# Hack Steps

1. Fetch the feedback page
2. Extract the csrf token and session cookie
3. Inject payload into the name field when submitting a feedback to execute the `whoami` command and redirect the output to a text file in a writable directory
4. Read the new created file


# Run Script

1. Change the URL of the lab
2. Start script

```
~$ python blind_os_command_injection_with_output_redirection.py
```

# Expected Output

```
âŸª#âŸ« Injection point: name
â¦—1â¦˜ Fetching the feedback page.. OK
â¦—2â¦˜ Extracting the csrf token and session cookie.. OK
â¦—3â¦˜ Injecting payload to execute the `whoami` command and redirect the output to whoami.txt.. OK
â¦—4â¦˜ Reading whoami.txt.. OK => peter-0jgr96
ğŸ—¹ The lab should be marked now as solved
