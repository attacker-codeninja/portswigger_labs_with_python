# Lab: Blind OS command injection with out-of-band interaction
#
# Steps: 1. Fetch the feedback page
#        2. Extract the csrf token and session cookie
#        3. Inject payload into the name field when submitting a feedback to
#           issue a DNS lookup to burp collaborator.
#        4. Check your burp collaborator for the DNS lookup
