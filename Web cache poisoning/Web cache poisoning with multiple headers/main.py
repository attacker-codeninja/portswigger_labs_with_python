# Lab: Web cache poisoning with multiple headers
#
# Hack Steps:
#      1. Store the malicious javascript file on your expoit server
#      2. Send multiple request to the tracking.js file with multiple
#         headers, one causes a redirect and the other makes the redirect 
#         point to your exploit server
#      3. The main page will be poisoned as it request the tracking.js file
