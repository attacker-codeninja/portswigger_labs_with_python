2. Change the DOMAIN of the expoit server
3. Start script

```

```

## Expected Output

```
â¦—1â¦˜ Storing the malicious javascript file on your exploit server.. OK
â¦—2â¦˜ Poisoning the tracking.js file with multiple headers (3/30)..
â¦—2â¦˜ Poisoning the tracking.js file with multiple headers (17/30).. OK
ðŸ—¹ The main page is poisoned successfully as it request the tracking.js file
